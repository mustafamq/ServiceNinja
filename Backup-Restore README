How to Use the Script:
Backup File: Ensure the C:\ServiceNinjaBackup.csv backup file exists, created by your previous script.
Run with Administrator Privileges: Since this script modifies service states, it needs to be run with administrator privileges.
Log File: The restoration process logs all actions to C:\ServiceNinjaRestoreLog.txt.
How to Run:
Copy the script to a .ps1 file (e.g., ServiceRestore.ps1).
Open PowerShell as Administrator.
Run the script:
powershell
Copy code
.\ServiceRestore.ps1
This script will restore the services to their original states using the backup file.
